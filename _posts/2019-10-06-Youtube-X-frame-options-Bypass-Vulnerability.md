I found this vulnerability back in December 2017, It was interesting as `X-frame-options :` response header was set but i was able to clickjack youtube parent domain and its sub domains. Now let's discuss the vulnerability in detail.

From the above screen shot you can see X-frame-options is set to same origin which only allows the current site to frame the content.

My Concept was : If the request is sent along with Referer: header set to google.com i.e `Referer: https://google.com`
