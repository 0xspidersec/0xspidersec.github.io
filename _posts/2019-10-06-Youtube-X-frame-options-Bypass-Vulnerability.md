I found this vulnerability back in December 2017, It was interesting as `X-frame-options :` response header was set to avoid clickjack but i was able to bypass it and clickjack the whole youtube domain and its sub domains. Now let's discuss the vulnerability in detail.

In the above screenshot you can see `X-frame-options` header is set to `sameorigin` which should only allows the current site to frame the contents.

Vulnerability was simple, If `Referer` header value can be set to `https://google.com` while browser makes the request to load contents inside the iframe, it was possible to clickjack.
